Report Task #4

1. Read sections 1.8 and 1.9.
Read. In sect 1.8, I have learnt that in C language: all functions arguements are passed by value which means that the values of arguements in a called function is given in temporary variables rather than the originals.
Also, I have learnt what character arrays are and also the program to illustrate them. However, the function part in the program seems to be somewhat confusing to me, but I gradually understand it.

2. Do exercises from these sections.
Done. Exercises are quite hard as I initially did not quite know what to do. So, I asked you to explain about the program provided in the section 1.9 to get the idea of how it works.
Moreover, I also watched C programming videos in Thai language to understand the C better.
