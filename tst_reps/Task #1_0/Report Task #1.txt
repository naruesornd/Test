Report Task #1

C is one of the programming languages like phython, C++ or Java.
However, it is neeither a high level language nor a big one, and is not specialized to 
any particular area of application.

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system by Dennis  Ritchie.

Overall, C is  a pleasant, expressive, and versatile language for a wide vatiety of programs. 
So, it is suitable for not just for progamming amatuers, but also for beginners like me.

In Chapter 1: 1.1 Getting Started

I learnt to utilize the CodeBlocks to code the C program, and understood of what the 
language looks like as well as the fundamental (terms and definitions) of C itself. 
I spent time to do try and error as in Ex. 1.1 in which I have provided the photo for you to see.
