Read. In section 1.10 allowed me to explore that declarations and variables can be written in another form with usage of "extern".
Also,  I leanrt the difference between definition and declaration.

2. Do exercises from these section.
Done. Exercises are quite hard, especially ex 1.20 and ex 1.21 as I did not what the questions wanted.
However, I think what I did might the most suitable so far.
