https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm
learn basic commands:
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands
and try to use a collection other commands:
https://helpdeskgeek.com/help-desk/21-cmd-commands-all-windows-users-should-know/
 Read. Windows command prompt or "cmd" is a command line field in a text-based user interface screen for an Windows. 
 I learnt to different ways to open this program as well as how to use it. There are more than 100 commands, but I learnt the basic ones like cd, dir, mkdir, ren, copy, xcopy, etc.
 These articles provide me with the foundation for Git cmd.

1. To read about versin control systems (vcs), repositories, branches (types and work with them), clone, pull, push, merge, conflict
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control
 Read. I learnt the termionlogy of vcs and the hitory of it. Initially after reading this article, I barely understand as the terms were hard to understand.
 I only begin to comprehend after I started to use github and git cmd.
 
2. To read about git and its basic commands (clone, pull, push, merge, status, log, branch, stash)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git and here https://git-scm.com/
 Read. I learnt to use basic commands of gits. Nevertheless, it was kind of confusing as the article did not really expain about the usage of each of commands, despite the fact that I had read it.
 I began to understand this when I read from other website and applied these commands in git cmd.

3. Install git. I recommend to use cli version of git (not GUI).
 Installed.

4. Create a github.com account.
  Created.

5. To make a repository for reports and push them there. Add Valentin Kovbas account ( https://github.com/Kovbas ) as a contributor to
 Made and added.

6. To create other repos and try to push there files, create branches and try to merge them.
 Done.

7. Read on wikipedia about programming paradigms. This page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm and other relater.
 Read. I learnt that programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
 However, a language can also be classified into multiple pardigms. I learnt what each programming paradigm is. For instance, imperative paradigm is used to instructs the machine how to change its state,
 while declarative paradigm allows the programmer to merely declare properties of the desired result, but now how to compute it. Each paradigm is divided into sub-paradigm like object- oriented languages belong to imperative paradigm or laguages.
 In general, I understood the overview of these things, but just do not know exactly in practical way.

Note! Since this task we will exchange reports and tasks by the repo. For every task you will create a branch with name "task-<task num
