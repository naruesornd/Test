Report Task #2

1. Read sections 1.4 and 1.5 with sub-sections.
Status: Read 
I have learnt to use symbilic constants and to code file copying, character counting, line counting and word counting.
At first, I have a trouble in understanding while loop, getchar() and EOF, but I understood now.

a) while loop 
It is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
If the condition "()" is false, then statement "{}" will be terminated and the execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. 

b) getchar()
It is one of the function which is used to accpet the single character (input) from the user.

c) EOF
It stands for END OF FILE. It is a value to indicate when the end of the input has been reached.

2. Do exercises from these sections.
Status: Done Ex.1.6-1.12
I learnt to verfiy getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1 and to write a program to print the value of EOF.
I learnt to write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. Also, COPY-INPUT-TO-OUTPUT programs.
I learnt to write a program that pritns input one word per line.
I learnt to use if function and else function.
